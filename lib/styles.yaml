# styles.yaml — shared instruction templates (Phase 4)
#
# These templates are intended for CustomVoice/VoiceDesign `instruct=` flows.
# Clone mode does not support runtime instruction control; instruction-like text
# cues are typically spoken literally.
#
# Schema:
#   <name>:
#     instruct: "Natural-language instruction text"
#
# Backward compatibility:
#   Older `prefix`/`suffix` entries are still parsed by lib/tts.py, but new
#   entries should use `instruct`.
